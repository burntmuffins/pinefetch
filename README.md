# How to install
## Dependencies required to run the script
- `sed`
- a shell that isn't too bare bones (e.g. dash shell)

## Installation
we can start by cloning the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/burntmuffins/pinefetch
```

now we can `cd` into the directory that we just cloned and copy the script to `/usr/local/bin`:
```
# cp ./pinefetch /usr/local/bin
```
now we should be able to run the script by just typing `pinefetch`
